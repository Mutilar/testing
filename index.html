					Alexis: Good afternoon I am Alexis Interiano and I am here with Alejandra Munoz. Today on fishy new we are here to talk about
					the Cosumnes River with Brian Hungerman a student at the University of California, Merced who is working with Professor
					Joshua Viers in the department of environmental science. Much of the research done here in on the Cosumnes river one
					of the last undammed rivers in California and there has been an awful lot of talk about wanting to dam the river.
					<br>
					<br> Ale: Exactly, as a society dammed rivers are normal, but with these proposals we are hearing about how damming the
					river could negatively impact the ecosystem and communities that are involved with the river. Many of our readers has
					requested that we get down to the truth behind these arguments, because they also see something fishy going on.
					<br>
					<br> Alexis: The Miwok tribe they resided in the area many years ago, but how did their actions in respecting the ecosystem
					in the past affect the current condition of the river?
					<br>
					<br> Brian: You know that's a great question Alex, I think understanding first of all the history of the river will help
					us understand where the conversation is going now. The Miwok tribe resided in the area for hundreds of years before
					European civilizations came into the region. Up until the gold rush really is when they were forced out of their habitat
					they lived around the Cosumnes River, living of off the native salmon, and local vegetation and they were able to have
					a symbiotic relationship with the river. Where they never took more than they needed and they always give back to the
					ecosystem to ensure their presence there did not hamper the ecosystem from thriving. It’s important to realize that
					the tribe could only thrive in this region because the river was undammed. The undammed nature of the river allowed
					for seasonal flooding which which promoted the growth of local vegetation which the Miwok people live off of as well
					as support of the presence of the salmon in the river.
					<br>
					<br> Ale: As we all know the endangered Valley Oak Tree is actually native to the river what about the undamnedness of the
					river actually allows it to thrive there?
					<br>
					<br> Brian: That’s a great question I think it’s important to know the context of the cosumnes River in this sense. The
					Cosumnes River is the only river in the Central Valley that is not damned. Now damming is an important part of the ecosystem
					because when a river is undamned it floods every season this flooding is nature's way of flushing out brush that is
					overpowering other plants and preventing their growth. You can imagine it like a rose bush you have to trim some leaves
					off of the rosebush to allow it to flower again this active flooding allows more vegetation to grow and the area.
					<br>
					<br> Alexis: So Brian you keep coming back to the flora and you mentioned the Miwok depending on the resources and an undammed
					river. Now how would salmons success or viability thrive in these conditions.
					<br>
					<br> Brian: Well it’s important to know that salmon was the tribes primary source of protein for hundreds of years. So the
					lifecycle of the salmon is important to understand. They breed and spawn upstream in the Cosumnes River. They swim all
					the way out to the Pacific ocean for the majority of their lives after they have matured they swim back up the river
					to their original spawning grounds and the cycle repeats. Now you throw a dam into this equation these salmon cannot
					get back to the original spawning grounds and die without having reproduced. For the Miwok people the salmon not returning
					was a life or death situation as is exactly what happen in the 1840s. As the first settlers from the goldrush constructed
					small levees and dams along the Cosumnes River for agricultural purposes.
					<br>
					<br> Ale: You continuously go back to the Miwok people surviving in the area off of the salmon and we do know that they
					were driven out of their homes but where are they now?
					<br>
					<br> Brian: I mean it’s a sad story. The tribe was very successful up until when the gold rush happened but in the 1840s
					many settlers from across the world came to the Central Valley with the hopes of striking it rich by finding gold. Most
					of this gold was originally found in rivers and streams so early settlers flocked to the river with the hopes of finding
					gold in it. You know after a few years they found there was not much gold to be found in the Cosumnes River so it was
					largely ignored. However, as civilization began to flourish in the Central Valley the need for agriculture and farming
					increased so there was a market then to alter some of the watersheds in the region to support the large agricultural
					project such as the growing of wheat and grain. There were some unintended side effects that the original settlers could
					not have foreseen one of the first things that affected was the salmon and not being able to reproduce and very quickly
					saw them not appearing in the river much longer after the 1840s. Now the Miwok people depending on the salmon for the
					majority of their protein, and without the salmon returning the Miwok people did not know what was happening to the
					salmon they were just continuing to fish and not finding fish in their waters so in desperation they moved out of the
					region for search of more food. They never really established anywhere else after that partially also due to the presence
					of more European colonies in the area it’s sad to say but in the late 1990s the last person that spoke the planes Miwok
					language passed away. Unfortunately there are people who have descended from the Miwok people yes that are still around
					but much of their language and culture has been lost to history. That something that we all hate to see and we are going
					to want to do much as we can and to not let these sorts of tragedies happen in the future.
					<br>
					<br> Alexis: You talk about these temporary dam projects how would damming the river be the cause for these effects such
					as the salmon depletion.
					<br>
					<br> Brian: YeahI mean it’s a complex biological system again the main issue here is when the salmon are trying to return
					upstream into their normal breeding grounds. When you throw a big line in the sand and they can’t cross over into where
					they want to go where they want to breed the salmon pass away.
					<br>
					<br> Alexis: So you are talking about temporary damming projects during the gold rush. But we are talking about how the
					Cosumnes River is undamed what happen there?
					<br>
					<br> Brian: I mean of course the Cosumnes River has a long history during the gold rush some levees and dams were constructed
					along the river to control it for more agricultural uses. In the 1970s I want to say there were some environmental moments
					that started to the creation of the Cosumnes River Preserve when they started realizing that these modifications to
					the river were negatively affecting many animals and that ecosystem these actions were taken to preserve the watershed
					for future generations. In the formation of the Cosumnes River Preserve many of these original Gold Rush era modifications
					were removed to try and get it back to that natural free-flowing state that allowed for such things as natural flooding
					which is crucial for the flora in that region.
					<br>
					<br> Ale: You mention that the were projects that were started in the past, but what project are there now and what research
					have you actually been doing with Professor Veirs?
					<br>
					<br> Brian: The Cosumnes River is a point of focus for the vice lab we are currently doing research to understand how these
					sorts of modifications to rivers can impact the ecosystems and watersheds that they are in. So some current research
					is going on that quite fascinates to me personally is actually trying to engineer artificial flooding along the Cosumnes
					River. So we are actually breaking apart the sides of the river banks along to Cosumnes River so the river floods more
					land in the rainy season and we are monitoring the vegetation growth in these regions and these artificially flooded
					zones to understand how important flooding is for the reinstatement of endangered flora.
					<br>
					<br> Alexis: Let me get this straight we are not damming the river, but you mentioned how working with the vice labs bulldozers
					are coming in and working on the river and helping it out, so there is some type of human contact with the river and
					projects going on.
					<br>
					<br> Brian: Right so I might seem kind of contradictory that we are still manipulating the flow of the river but it is important
					to understand that we are not trying to hold back the river anymore we’re actually trying to get the river back to its
					original state. That of the terrain around it so that it is as free flowing as possible and floods the most area as
					possible, because for every acre we are increasing in the rivers floodplain we are increasing the amount of biomass
					and flora and fauna in that region exponentially. So there are a lot of efforts right now going on to try and make small
					edits to the river to allow to reclaim the watershed as a did before the gold rush.
					<br>
					<br> Ale: So you talk a lot about how the people you are working with are specifically trying to positively impact the river
					but there are some proposals that are coming up about people who want to dam the river how do you feel about that and
					what’s your opinion
					<br>
					<br> Brian: You know it’s hard for me given my experience with the Cosumnes I’ve been working very closely with the Cosumnes
					for over a year now. I kind of have the inside scoop as to why the Cosumnes is such a magical place not only for researchers
					like me but also for the general public you know. I guess these proposals do makes sense from a civil engineering perspective
					flooding is damaging and has damaged in the past farms and cities in the region. Most notably in the early 1900s Sacramento
					was actually damage from flooding from the same watershed that the Cosumnes River is in so it's understandable to see
					that these city architects are concerned letting such a free flowing river be so close to these large civilizations.
					Of course it is important to mention that basically all of the central valley is heavily urbanized and is hard to find
					any place that we can truly allow nature to be natural. Yes this flooding is actually still a double edge sword yes
					it can cause much damage to local infrastructure but it is also vitally important for the ecosystem. You know we’re
					talking earlier about the the Valley Oak tree this tree is actually the main reason why there haven't been dams constructed
					on it so far and it is actually the reason that so many proposals to dam the river have been for the most part denied
					up until this point. There has been quite a bit of research suggesting that if we had damned the Cosumnes river there’s
					a high likelihood that the Valley Oak Tree could go extinct you know so from my experience it would be quite flippant
					to think that the prevention of a few million dollars of property damage would justify completely removing one species
					from this planet and decimating the flora of this watershed. So in this sense damming the river would actually be much
					more destructive than letting it floods seasonally.
					<br>
					<br> Alexis: Staying on the thought of preventing the damming of the river what others ways would keeping the river undammed
					benefit society
					<br>
					<br> Brian: Well Alex there are numerous primarily this is a lot of what we have been talking about today and of course
					you could have podcasts full of information of other ways why the Cosumnes needs to stay undamned in my expert opinion.
					So it functions importantly as a wildlife preserve the Cosumnes Wildlife Preserve features many endangered plants and
					animals in the region, but in addition to this there are also numerous things that would be affected if we dammed the
					river. In my field this is an important research opportunity studying the Consonus River and how it reacts to man-made
					manipulation. The research that we are doing on the Cosumnes river is not only applicable to the Central Valley but
					to all of California and the world. When other nations are considering environmental projects like dams they can look
					to the Cosumnes River as an important case study for seeing why it is important to keep nature natural. Lastly there
					is the idea of ecotourism the Cosumnes River has been a popular destination for locals for such activities as kayaking,
					camping, and really enjoying and immersing themselves in nature and we don’t want to ruin that opportunity for future
					generations
					<br>
					<br> Ale: Well a lot of the information you gave us today is very interesting what if some of your audience has suddenly
					become very interested in helping with this project how can they do that.
					<br>
					<br> Brian: Well that’s a great question I think if we want to keep pushing the sorts of research opportunities forward
					first of all we need to keep the Cosumnes River undammed. Ways you can support that as you are saying is by taking a
					day trip out to the Cosumnes Preserve there’s a great Visitor Center there. Even if you are immersed in nature you don’t
					realize that you are so close to Sacramento and to all these big destinations because you kind of get lost in the foliage.
					Also let your local representative know that you are unhappy with there sorts of proposals to dam the Cosumnes River,
					because right now the people who are writing these proposals are in the end trying to help the local communities and
					prevent damage from flooding. Let’s make sure that our representatives know that we also appreciate having nature around
					us and not trying to control nature too much. If we can get our representatives in the California Senate to be aware
					of these sorts of environmental issues I think it would help a lot into making sure that these proposals don’t get much
					further than they are now. Lastly I think that the easiest thing for us to do it that isn’t very time-consuming is to
					let your peers know about this reach out to them on social media let people know what’s going on with the Cosumnes and
					why this is an issue that affects all of us.
					<br>
					<br> Alexis: Well unfortunately that’s all we have time for, but Brian if they like to get contact with you what’s the best
					way to contact you.
					<br>
					<br> Brian: Of course Alex and Alejandra I appreciate you guys having me on Fishy News if you wanna learn more or you can
					go to consumingthecosumnes.com. That’s where you can reach out to me and learn more about what our research lab is doing.
					Thanks guys.
					<br>
					<br> Alex: Well again thank you very much for coming out and talking to us Brian. Thank you to our audience for joining
					us today on our episode of Fishy news. We hope that you'll join us next week for an exclusive on the fishy effects of
					air pollution.

				<h2 class="major">What’s the Dam Deal?</h2>
				<!-- <h4>Blockquote</h4> -->
				<blockquote>
					<strong>
						The Cosumnes River is the last remaining canary in the coal mine against the Central Valley’s unchecked and unregulated agroindustrial
						complex
					</strong>
				</blockquote>

				<section>
					<h3 class="major">Why We Shouldn’t Dam the Cosumnes</h3>
					<p>
						The Cosumnes River, the last undammed river in California’s Central Valley, stems from the Sierra Nevada Mountains and flows
						through uppermost California. As dam construction rapidly increases to match the demands of agricultural and industrial
						sectors, the relevance of analyzing this undammed river and its distinctiveness becomes most critical. Not long ago,
						in Fall 2014, a group of people formed the Cosumnes Coalition program with the aims of restoring and protecting the
						river and its ecosystem. Now partnered with many other representatives, such as UC Merced experts, this coalition program
						continues to lead the river’s conservation movement while encouraging nearby communities to collaborate in their efforts.
						By looking at the Cosumnes River’s unique vegetation, aquatic life, and cultural ties, one can best see the significance
						of such a group’s movement and understand why this river should remain undammed.


					</p>
					<span class="image main">
						<img src="images/river.JPG" alt="" />
					</span>
					<h3 class="major">Where Water Flows Plants Grow </h3>
					<p>
						Unobstructed by dams and able to flow freely, the Cosumnes River and its floodplains, thrive with diverse vegetation. Delicate
						lavender beethistles scatter the riverbanks while majestic California Oaks shelter the vast green land that goes on
						for miles adjacent to the river. Known to have one of the richest riparian floodlands in all of California, this river
						is unlike any other. Nevertheless, should this river be dammed, this would no longer be the case. You see, dams pose
						a threat to floodplain vegetation. When heavy rain accumulates within the walls of a dam, the high-pressured water
						flows are forced to breach the dams, overall resulting in the detrimental flooding and harming of nearby vegetation.
						Dams also work against a river’s vegetation because they discourage sediment and seedlings from passing through. Retaining
						much of its natural hydrology, the Cosumnes River’s flood waters, on the other hand, do not destroy vegetation. Its
						free-flowing floodwaters spread across floodpains, carrying sediment, and distributing plant seedlings, thereby contributing
						to the growth of an ecosystem. As of today, the Cosumnes River’s Preserve consists of “40,000 acres of riparian forests,
						wetlands, vernal pool grasslands and agriculture,” with over 15% of these acres purely devoted to oaks and willows.
						Given this enormous amount of vegetation, it thus comes to no surprise that the river’s waters are also filled with
						a bounty of fish, all whom depend on the plants for nourishment and habitat.
					</p>
					<h3 class="major">
						Fish Passage</h3>
					<p>
						The Cosumnes River accommodates a variety of fish species. Constrained by no borders, the fish that inhabit this river, have
						the ability to migrate up and downstream, access nurseries and food sources, and live a long life that would’ve been
						cut short had the river been dammed. Dams present problems to fish, specifically flow-sensitive fish. A study looking
						at dams and their effects on fish species, found a total of 412 dams, many concentrated within southern California’s
						coast and the Sierra Nevada foothills, to have lost flow-sensitive fish species. Additionally, all of these dams were
						near fish that are known to be endangered. One particular fish population that’s been most studied in regards to the
						Cosumnes River is the Chinook salmon. Studying these fish is crucial to understanding the negative effects that dams
						pose on a river’s aquatic life. Chinook salmon are a migratory species. Originally born in freshwater, these fish then
						migrate to the sea, to then return back to freshwater to spawn. However, their ability to migrate and reproduce is
						drastically impaired when dams are placed in their way. Dams impede a salmon’s upstream passage and as a result not
						many of them get to reach the spawning habitat and die. But this need not apply to salmon traveling alongside the Cosumnes
						River. Because of the Cosumnes River’s natural hydrology, salmon and other migratory fish are able to successfully
						migrate upwards and reproduce. It is also because of this river’s free flowing streams and fish abundance, that this
						river has such a rich history of settlement. The Cosumnes River, its vegetation, and its fish also sustain human life.

					</p>
					<h3 class="major">
						Cosumnes Culture and the Miwok People </h3>
					<p>
						Years before the Cosumnes River Preserve stood in place, a group of people, known as the Miwok, inhabited the land near the
						Cosumnes. The Miwok thrived by the river, cherishing the fish and plants that it provided. Unfortunately, after the
						Gold Rush struck, the Miwok were forced to leave their territory and relocate elsewhere. Though the Miwok no longer
						live there, the Cosumnes River Preserve continues to receive many visitors looking to learn about their ancestral land
						and, as told by the CCAW, “hear the voice of the waters, the land, the plants and the trees.” Descendants of the Miwok
						now walk the trails of the preserve imagining what life was like for their ancestors, and seeking to pass on their
						wisdom of the river’s vitality to anyone willing to learn. This land, this river, marks a sacred place in Miwok culture.
						Dam this river, and you destroy what remains of this group’s sacred land.

					</p>
					<h3 class="major">
						Let the River Flow </h3>
					<p>
						Although, having only recently been established, the Cosumnes Coalition program is rapidly increasing in momentum. With the
						river’s diverse vegetation, aquatic life, and history in mind, this program prides itself in promoting restorative
						and sustainable river usage practices. Nonetheless, this program would not be where they are at without the help of
						the public. For it takes an informed community to keep this conservation movement alive.

					</p>
					<h3 class="major">
						Want to Get Involved?
					</h3>
					<p>
						This coalition and their partnerships need all the help they can receive and you can get involved. Sign up to volunteer at
						the Cosumnes River Preserve and help staff with conservation projects or get involved with Cosumnes Culture and Waterways
						(CCAW) to learn more about Miwok culture and river practices.
